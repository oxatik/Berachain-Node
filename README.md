# Berachain Node
Berachain is a Layer 1 EVM-compatible chain, supporting any EVM execution client paired with a consensus client and framework called BeaconKit, Berachain nodes consist of a consensus client and an execution client. The consensus client is called beacon-kit and the execution client can be any of the ethereum clients go-ethereum, reth, nethermind,Proof-of-Liquidity is a novel consensus mechanism that aims to align network incentives, creating a strong synergy between Berachain validators and the ecosystem of projects.Berachain‚Äôs technology is built on Polaris, a high-performance blockchain framework for building EVM-compatible chains on top of the CometBFT consensus engine.

 # Berachain: An Overview
 Berachain stands out as a major advancement in the blockchain universe, thanks to its revolutionary consensus mechanism, Proof of Liquidity (PoL). This high-performance blockchain, compatible with the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM), is based on Polaris and the CometBFT consensus engine, offering a robust and versatile alternative to existing infrastructures. The PoL does not just secure the network; it also aims to strengthen cooperation between validators and applications, promoting a fair distribution of rewards and stimulating liquidity. With an impressive fundraising of $42 million, supported by leading investors, Berachain positions itself as a key player in blockchain evolution, promising a more inclusive and efficient ecosystem.

# Requirements for Deploying a Berachain Node
*System: Linux Ubuntu 20.04 or newer

*CPU: Quad-core

*RAM: 16 GB

*Storage: 500 GB SSD

To host a Berachain node, opt for a VPS 2 server. I chose Contabo for its reliability and performance, ideal for meeting the technical requirements of Berachain.

# Preparing to Configure a Berachain Node Locally

Berachain is currently in the testnet phase. The Bera Node, an evolution of the Polaris project, brings several significant improvements. This guide will walk you through configuring a local node in anticipation of the Genesis file publication necessary to connect to the network. It‚Äôs important to note that the binaries needed to run a full validator node are not yet publicly accessible. This guide will help you prepare your testing environment and be ready for the official launch.

## Installation
#  Run a Berachain üêª ‚õìÔ∏è node for the Artio testnet
we run both go-ethereum and reth nodes, and for this guide we'll use reth. You can run a node that syncs from genesis if you want, or you can use a snapshot that we created that'll help you sync much faster.

# Install dependencies
Make sure you your machine has go and rust installed because we'll be compiling beacon-kit and reth

* Install go (minimum version v1.22.4)

* Install rust (minimum version v1.79.0)

# Download snapshot
i have created a snapshot you can use. The snapshot has both the consensus layer state (for beacon-kit) and the execution layer state (for reth)




```bash
 sudo apt-get install lz4

mkdir bera
cd bera

wget 'https://public-snapshots.ghostgraph.xyz/bera-testnet-20240815.tar.lz4'

tar --use-compress-program=lz4 -xvf bera-testnet-20240815.tar.lz4

ls bera-snapshot
## you should see:
## beacond-data reth-data 
```
# Build the clients
Now lets build the consensus client (beacon-kit) and the execution client (we'll use reth)
```bash
## still in bera dir

git clone https://github.com/berachain/beacon-kit/
git clone https://github.com/paradigmxyz/reth

## build beacon-kit which will serve as the consensus client
cd beacon-kit
git checkout v0.2.0-alpha.2
make

## build reth which will serve as the execution client
cd ../reth
git checkout v1.0.1
cargo build --release  
```
# Run Reth
```bash
cd ~/bera/reth/
./target/release/reth node \
	--datadir ../bera-snapshot/reth-data \
	--chain ../bera-snapshot/beacond-data/config/eth-genesis.json \
	--instance 2 \
	--http \
	--ws  
```
If you have cast installed you can confirm the node is using the snapshot data

```bash
$ cast bn -r 'http://localhost:8544'
1517942  
```
# Run Beacon-kit
```bash
cd ~/bera/beacon-kit

## generate priv_validator_key.json and priv_validator_state.json files
## we'll use the beacon-kit init command
## in a temp location and extract just these files

./build/bin/beacond init --home tmp-bera --chain-id 80084 tmp-bartio
cp tmp-bera/config/priv_validator_key.json ../bera-snapshot/beacond-data/config/
cp tmp-bera/data/priv_validator_state.json ../bera-snapshot/beacond-data/data/

## now let's run the consensus client
